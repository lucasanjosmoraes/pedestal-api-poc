## Usage

### From command line

You can start the **API** in **DEV** or **PROD** mode with `lein run-dev` and `lein run` respectively. If you need to
debug your **API** using **REPL**, there are some commands available to help:

```clj
;; To start the API
(start-dev)

;; To stop
(stop-dev)

;; or restart
(restart)

;; You can use this helper to do a specific request
(test-request :post "/todo")
```

### From Intellij

There are scripts in the directory `.run` that allow you to run REPL, start **API** in **DEV** or **PROD** mode. You
just need to choose one of them from the dropdown menu and press play üõÄüèΩ.
